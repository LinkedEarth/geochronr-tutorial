# Installing the software you need {#installation}

You need R and probably RStudio

## Loading a LiPD file

The `lipdR` package is your gateway to working with LiPD data. To install `lipdR`, you'll need the remotes package if you don't already have it.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("nickmckay/lipdR")
remotes::install_github("nickmckay/geoChronR")
```
